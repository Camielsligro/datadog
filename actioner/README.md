# Actioner

## Overview

Actioner is a no-code app builder that lets you build your own apps for Slack and workflow automations without coding
anything.

publish or fetch data by itself, but a workflow in which Datadog API calls are made can be constructed.

## Setup

Once you install the integration, click the "Connect Account" button in Datadog. This should redirect you to Actioner
account,
where you can establish OAuth2 connection.
