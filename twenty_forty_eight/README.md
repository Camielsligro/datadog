# Twenty Forty Eight

## Overview

Twenty Forty Eight is an easy and fun game you can add to your Datadog dashboards. This fun extension is made possible by [Datadog apps](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/datadog_apps) including the ability to extend the user-interface with third party content not supported natively. If you are interested in extending your datadog experience for buisiness or for fun, we encourage you to build or apps of your own.

### How to play

Click on the widget to activate the app, then use your **arrow keys** to move the tiles. Tiles with the same number **merge into one** when they touch. Add them up to reach 2048 and beyond!

## Setup

1. In your Datadog account, navigate to Dashboards. Select the dashboard that you would like to add the Game to, or [create a new dashboard](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/#new-dashboard).

2. In the dashboard, click **+Add Widgets** to the right of the dashboard title. Scroll to the right through the widgets, and then drag and drop the **Twenty Forty Eight** widget into the desired position on your dashboard.
