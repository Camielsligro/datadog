# Instabug integration
## Overview:

[Instabug](http://instabug.com) helps mobile teams proactively improve the quality of their mobile apps and deliver the high-quality experience users expect and deserve. Our APM, Crash Reporting, and Bug Reporting tools will help optimize your app's performance and deliver the high-quality experience your users expect and deserve.

On Datadog, Instabug provides a dashboard widget that will help you monitor your overall app health and how the user perceives your app's performance with just one number, the App Apdex. Through the widget you will get:
- The overall App Apdex score
- App Apdex overtime.
- Break down the sessions into 4 buckets (Satisfying, Tolerable, Frustrating or Crashing sessions).
- The latest 5 bug reports and the total number of new reports.
