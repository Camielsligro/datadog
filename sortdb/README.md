2. Run `ddev release build sortdb` to build the package.
3. [Download the Datadog Agent][2].
4. Upload the build artifact to any host with an Agent and run `datadog-agent integration install -w path/to/sortdb/dist/<ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl`.

## Configuration

1. Edit the `sortdb.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][4] to start collecting your Sortdb [metrics](#metric-collection) and [logs](#log-collection).
  See the [sample sortdb.d/conf.yaml][5] for all available configuration options.
