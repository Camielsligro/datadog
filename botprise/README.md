## Overview

Botprise's Datadog integration allows you to send [Botprise][7] events to the event stream in Datadog. It submits Datadog events into the system over email.

## Setup


### Installation


### Configuration
1. Install the Datadog Agent on your lab devices.
2. After successful installation, your devices start sending data to Datadog. View the data on the [Datadog host list][3].
3. In Datadog, create a monitor for each of the hosts. Datadog generates alerts based on the monitor rules.
4. Configure each monitor for [metrics][4] and the respective threshold value.
5. Modify the monitor configuration to create a [ServiceNow][6] ticket for each of the incoming alerts.
6. Generate an [API key and an Application key][5] to call Datadog Rest APIs.
