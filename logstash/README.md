# Logstash Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Logstash service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor Logstash states.
* Be notified about Logstash events.

## Setup
### Installation

Install the `dd-check-logstash` package manually or with your favorite configuration manager.

### Configuration

Edit the `logstash.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor.

### Validation

[Run the Agent's `info` subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/faq/agent-status-and-information/), you should see something like the following:

    Checks
    ======

      logstash 
      -----------------
        - instance #0 [OK]
        - Collected 61 metrics, 0 events & 1 service check

## Compatibility

The Logstash check is compatible with Logstash 5.6 and possible earlier versions. Currently it does not support the new pipelines metrics in Logstash 6.0 yet.

## Data Collected
### Metrics
See [metadata.csv](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/blob/master/logstash/metadata.csv) for a list of metrics provided by this integration.

### Events
The Logstash check does not include any events at this time.

### Service checks

`logstash.can_connect`:

Returns `Critical` if the Agent cannot connect to Logstash to collect metrics.

## Troubleshooting

### Agent cannot connect
```
    logstash
    -------
      - instance #0 [ERROR]: "('Connection aborted.', error(111, 'Connection refused'))"
      - Collected 0 metrics, 0 events & 1 service check
```

Check that the `url` in `logstash.yaml` is correct.
