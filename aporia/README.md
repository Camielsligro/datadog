# Agent Check: Aporia

## Overview

Aporia is an ML observability platform. This integration allows Datadog users to report their Aporia alerts to Datadog for a unified monitoring system.

This integration includes an intuitive dashboard to view all Aporia alerts over time and by configured severity.

Additional customization is available using supplied event tags.

## Setup

### Installation

First, you'll need an Aporia account. Visit [Aporia][1] to create your account.

Once an account is available, [login to your Aporia account][2], then visit the Aporia integrations page and add a Datadog integration. You'll be requested to provide your Datadog API key to grant Aporia the necessary permissions to your Datadog account.

### Configuration
