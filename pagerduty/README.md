# PagerDuty

## Overview

PagerDuty is a real-time operations platform which is continuously processing, analyzing,
and routing event data. Our system acts as an aggregation point for data coming from multiple 
monitoring tools and can provide a holistic view of your current state of operations. PagerDuty 
allows Datadog customers to enable more effective incident response while increasing visibility 
and accountability throughout the incident lifecycle. PagerDuty delivers two new apps that will 
give our customers all the capabilities of our real-time operations platform, wherever they work
without the need to switch tools. Users can easily add these new widgets, Status Dashboard by PagerDuty 
and Incidents by PagerDuty, directly to their dashboard to see the service status dashboard and respond 
to high-urgency incidents directly from Datadog in real time.

### Status Dashboard by PagerDuty

Status Dashboard by PagerDuty provides technical responders, business responders, 
and technical and business leaders a live, shared view of system health to improve 
awareness of operational issues. It displays the current service status and sends 
notifications to alert users when business services are being impacted. This feature
improves communication between response teams and stakeholders during incidents.
