# AngularJS Integration

## Overview

With the Datadog [AngularJS integration][1], resolve performance issues quickly in AngularJS components by:

- Debugging the root cause of performance bottlenecks, such as a slow server response time, render-blocking resource, or error inside a component
- Automatically correlating AngularJS performance data with user journeys, AJAX calls to the server side, and logs
- Alerting your engineering teams when crucial performance metrics for AngularJS (such as Core Web Vitals) fall below a threshold that results in a poor user experience


Monitor your AngularJS applications from end-to-end by:

- Tracking and visualizing user journeys across your entire stack
- Debugging the root cause of slow load times, which may be an issue with your React code, network performance, or underlying infrastructure 
- Analyzing and contextualizing every user session with attributes such as user ID, email, name, and more
- Unifying full-stack monitoring in one platform for frontend and backend development teams

## Setup

### Collect RUM events 

To start collecting Real User Monitoring events from your application, see [AngularJS Monitoring][2]. 

### Collect traces 

Your AngularJS application automatically sends traces to Datadog.

### Collect logs 

To start forwarding your AngularJS application's logs to Datadog, see [AngularJS Log Collection][3].

Data Collected

### Metrics

The AngularJS integration does not include any metrics. To generate custom metrics from your RUM application, see [Generate Metrics][4].

### Events 

For more information about events and attributes, see [RUM AngularJS Data Collected][5]. 

### Service Checks 

The AngularJS integration does not include any service checks.
