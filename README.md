# Datadog Agent Integrations

Collecting data is cheap; not having it when you need it can be very expensive. So we recommend instrumenting as much of your systems and applications as possible. This integrations repository will help you do that by making it easier to create and share new integrations for [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com).

# Building Integrations

For more information about how to build a new integration, please see [the guide at docs.datadoghq.com](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/integration_sdk/).

# Submitting Your integration

Once you have completed the development of your integration, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-extras/compare) to have Datadog review your integration. Once we've reviewed your integration, we will approve and merge your pull request or provide feedback and next steps required for approval.

# Reporting Issues

For more information on integrations, please reference our [documentation](http://docs.datadoghq.com) and [knowledge base](https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us). You can also visit our [help page](http://docs.datadoghq.com/help/) to connect with us.
