## Setup

Download and install the [Datadog Agent](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent/overview), then follow the instructions below to install and configure this integration for an Agent running on a host.


## Installation

Refer to Datadogâ€™s [community integrations installation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/community-integrations-installation-with-docker-agent/?tab=agentabovev68) page for the specific steps to install the NS1 integration as an add-on, since it is not packaged and built into the Datadog Agent. 

**Note**: The minimum Agent version required for supporting integrations is 7.21.0. NS1 recommends using the latest version of the Datadog Agent.

When running the installation process, make sure to do so using the following variables specific to the NS1 integration:


* <INTEGRATION_NAME>:  NS1
* <INTEGRATION_VERSION>:  0.0.3

### Validation

To validate your Agent and integration configuration, [run the Agent's status subcommand](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/guide/agent-commands/#agent-status-and-information) and look for ns1 under the Checks section.
