# Agent Check: Anecdote

## Overview

Anecdote is an AI-driven platform that automatically detects, tracks, organizes, and prioritizes bugs reported by users from your customer feedback.  

With Anecdote, developers can ensure that no customer-reported bug goes unnoticed. Our app meticulously analyzes all of your fragmented feedback sources in near-real-time, making it easier to promptly address issues.

Anecdote monitors customer feedback from more than 80 sources, including support tickets from Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk, and others; public reviews from platforms like the App Store, Google Play, and Trustpilot; social media comments on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook; and customer surveys from SurveyMonkey, Typeform, Medallia, etc. By aggregating and analyzing user-reported bugs in a unified dashboard, developers gain a comprehensive view of customer feedback, enabling them to prioritize and address issues more effectively.
