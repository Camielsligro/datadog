# Snmpwalk Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from SNMP walk service in real time to:

* Visualize and monitor SNMP walk states
* Be notified about SNMP walk failovers and events.


## Setup

The SNMP walk check is **NOT** included in the [Datadog Agent][1] package.

### Installation

To install the SNMP walk check on your host:

1. Install the [developer toolkit][3] on any machine.
2. Run `ddev release build snmpwalk` to build the package.
3. [Download the Datadog Agent][1].
4. Upload the build artifact to any host with an Agent and run `datadog-agent integration install -w path/to/snmpwalk/dist/<ARTIFACT_NAME>.whl`.

### Configuration

To configure the SNMP walk check:

1. Create a `snmpwalk.d/` folder in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your Agent's directory.
2. Create a `conf.yaml` file in the `snmpwalk.d/` folder previously created.
3. Consult the [sample snmpwalk.yaml][6] file and copy its content in the `conf.yaml` file.
4. Edit the `conf.yaml` file to point to your server and port, set the masters to monitor.
5. [Restart the Agent][3].

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][4] and look for `snmpwalk` under the Checks section.
