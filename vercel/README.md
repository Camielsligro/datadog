# Agent Check: Vercel

## Overview

[Vercel][1] is a deployment and collaboration platform that enables frontend developers to build high-performance websites and applications. Vercel is also the creator of Next.js, a React framework developed in collaboration with engineers at Google and Facebook in 2016. Vercel users can leverage a built-in deployment tool that manages the build and rendering process, as well as a proprietary [Edge Network][2] that caches their sites for fast retrieval. Additionally, Vercel offers [Serverless Functions][3], which allow users to deploy serverless code to accomplish essential backend processes like user authentication, form submission, and database queries.

Integrate Vercel with Datadog to:

* View and parse your application logs using [Datadogâ€™s Log Management][4]
* See the number of requests and 4xx/5xx HTTP errors to your serverless applications and APIs running on Vercel
* Monitor frontend performance with [Datadog Synthetics][5]

* Generate a [Datadog API key][6]
