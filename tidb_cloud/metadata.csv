tidb_cloud.db_database_time,gauge,,second,,A time model statistic that is the sum of all process' CPU consumption plus the sum of non-idle wait time.,0,tidb_cloud,,
tidb_cloud.db_query_per_second,gauge,,query,,"The number of SQL statements executed per second on all TiDB instances, which is counted according to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and other types of statements",0,tidb_cloud,,
tidb_cloud.db_failed_queries,gauge,,query,,"The statistics of error types (such as syntax errors and primary key conflicts) according to the errors occurred when executing SQL statements per second on each TiDB instance.",0,tidb_cloud,,
tidb_cloud.db_command_per_second,gauge,,command,,"The number of commands processed by TiDB per second, which is classified according to the success or failure of command execution results",0,tidb_cloud,,
tidb_cloud.db_queries_using_plan_cache_ops,gauge,,operator,,"The statistics of queries using Plan Cache per second. The execution plan cache only supports the prepared statement command. If the value is 0, the execution plan cache has not been hit.",0,tidb_cloud,,
tidb_cloud.db_average_query_duration,gauge,,second,,"The duration between the time that the client's network request is sent to TiDB and the time that the request is returned to the client after TiDB has executed it. In general, client requests are sent in the form of SQL statements, but can also include the execution time of commands such as COM_PING, COM_SLEEP, COM_STMT_FETCH, and COM_SEND_LONG_DATA. Because TiDB supports Multi-Query, it supports sending multiple SQL statements at one time, such as select 1; select 1; select 1;. In this case, the total execution time of this query includes the execution time of all SQL statements",0,tidb_cloud,,
