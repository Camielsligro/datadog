# Android Integration

## Overview

With Datadog Android integration, you can

Spend less time triaging issues, and more time releasing new features
- Debug the root cause of slow performance issues and app crashes whether its because of 3rd party libraries, network requests or large media files
- Improve app responsiveness, set up SLIs and diagnose issues with out-of-the-box dashboards, real-time metrics and deobfuscated crash reports
- Intelligently group high-volume application errors into a manageable set of unique issues

Correlate the impact user experience has on your business
- Analyze critical mobile user experience data like screen engagement by demographics, version releases or any custom attributes to reach your business KPIs
- Automatically correlate every user journey with a timeline of session events and attributes like ID, cellular activity, referral URL and more
- Understand user behavior trends with customizable analytics and geographical maps

Monitor end-to-end health of your application
- Pivot from user experience data to backend traces, runtime metrics and logs for complete context when investigating issues
- Debug crashes faster by unifying client-side and server-side metrics, traces, and logs
- Unify full-stack monitoring in a single platform for frontend and backend teams
