# Neo4j Integration

## Overview

Get metrics from Neo4j service in real time to:

- Visualize and monitor Neo4j states.
- Be notified about Neo4j failovers and events.

## Setup

The Neo4j check is not included in the [Datadog Agent][2] package, so you need to install it.

### Installation

For Agent v7.21+ / v6.21+, follow the instructions below to install the Neo4j check on your host. See [Use Community Integrations][3] to install with the Docker Agent or earlier versions of the Agent.

1. Run the following command to install the Agent integration:

   ```shell
   datadog-agent integration install -t datadog-neo4j==<INTEGRATION_VERSION>
   ```

2. Configure your integration similar to core [integrations][4].

### Configuration

1. Edit the `neo4j.d/conf.yaml` file in the `conf.d/` folder at the root of your [Agent's configuration directory][6] to start collecting your Neo4j [metrics](#metric-collection). See the [sample neo4j.d/conf.yaml][7] for all available configuration options.

2. [Restart the Agent][8]

## Validation

[Run the Agent's `status` subcommand][9] and look for `neo4j` under the Checks section.
