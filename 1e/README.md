# 1E

## Overview

The 1E Datadog integration enables you to automatically send 1E metrics to your Datadog account.

## Setup

### Configuration

Getting set up with the 1E Datadog integration is as simple as emailing a Datadog API key and region to 1E Support team. There's no further configuration required.

1. Go to your [Datadog Integrations page][1] and click on the 1E tile. Then go to the **Configuration** tab and click **Install Integration** at the bottom.

2. Go to your [Datadog APIs page][2] and create an API key.

3. Determine your Datadog API region by looking at your browser's address bar:

- If the domain name is `app.datadoghq.com`, then your API region is `US`.
- If the domain name is `app.datadoghq.eu`, then your API region is `EU`.

4. Send mail to 1E support with Datadog API key and region to Activate 1E Datadog Integration.

5. Once support team send success mail, Go to the Datadog metrics explorer to see your metrics.
