# 1E

## Overview

The 1E Datadog Integration is an API-based integration that collects metrics from 1E products and forwards them to your Datadog account. These metrics are visualized on the out-of-the-box dashboard, and can also be used to  create your own visualizations. 

## Setup

### Configuration

Getting set up with the 1E Datadog integration is simple, and requires the following:

1. Go to your [Datadog Integrations page][1] and click on the 1E tile.

2. Click the **Configuration** tab and click **Install Integration** at the bottom.

3. Go to your [Datadog API Keys Management page][2] and create an API key.

4. Determine your [Datadog site][6] by looking at your browser's address bar:

   - If the domain name is `app.datadoghq.com`, your site is `US`.
   - If the domain name is `app.datadoghq.eu`, your site is `EU`.

5. Send an email to [1E support](mailto:support@1e.com) with the Datadog API key and site to activate your 1E Datadog integration.

6. 1Es team will be in touch once your account has been set up. Once it's been setup, navigate to the [Metrics Explorer][7] within Datadog to see metrics begin to flow in.
