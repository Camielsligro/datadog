# 1E

## Overview

The 1E Datadog Integration is an API-based integration that collects metrics from 1E products and forwards them to your Datadog account. These metrics are visualized on the out-of-the-box dashboard, and can also be used to create your own visualizations.

## Setup

### Configuration

Getting set up with the 1E Datadog integration is simple, and requires the following:

1. After clicking "**Install Integration**" on this tile, go to your [Datadog API Keys Management page][2] and create an API key.

2. Determine your [Datadog site][6] to use.

3. Get in touch with [1E support](mailto:support@1e.com) with the Datadog API key and site to activate your 1E Datadog integration.

4. 1Es team will be in touch once your account has been set up. Once it's been setup, navigate to the [Metrics Explorer][7] within Datadog to see metrics begin to flow in.
