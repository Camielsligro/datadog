# incident.io

![datadog-integration][4]

## Overview

Global technology companies use [incident.io][1] to empower teams to run incidents end-to-end. Fix and learn from incidents, so you can build more resilient products.

When you trigger an incident using PagerDuty or OpsGenie, incident.io automatically pulls through any associated information about your Datadog monitors, putting all the information you need in your incident channel.

## Setup

To get started, connect PagerDuty or OpsGenie to Datadog. Then, set up incident triggers inside incident.io. See the [incident.io Datadog integration][2] for details.

## Support

Contact incident.io's support team via Intercom on [the website][1], or reach out to the [support team][3].
