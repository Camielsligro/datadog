# incident.io

![datadog-integration][4]

## Overview

Global technology companies use [incident.io][1] to empower teams to run incidents end-to-end. Rapidly fix and learn from incidents, so you can build more resilient products.

When you trigger incidents using PagerDuty or OpsGenie, incident.io will automatically pull through any associated information about your Datadog monitors, putting all the information you need right in your incident channel.

## Setup

To get started, you need to first connect PagerDuty or OpsGenie to Datadog, then setup incident triggers inside incident.io - details on how to do that can be found in the [incident.io documentation][2]
